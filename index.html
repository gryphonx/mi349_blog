            This school yeas has began with an incredible start, as many people
            have come back to live at MSU. East Lansing is bustling with life again
            and it is such a pleasure to see people walking around the city again.
            Throughout the day, buses and cars go by as people are on their way to
            class or work: and during the night, crowds walk through the city seeking
            some attraction. Often times, I see this as "Nature is Healing", people
            have finally returned to the college lifestyle and are enjoying every
            second of it. It's sweet, to see campus bustling with so many activities
            going on, and to see the active population taking part. With this positive 
            start, I believe that the rest of this year will follow suit, with the
            spring semester finishing strong. Throughout this time, my schedule has
            become: wake up, go to class, come home, and then go out. It is truly
            an exhilirating experience, with so much to do, and tons and tons of new
            people to meet and hang out with. My only hope is that this kind of life
            can continue, even with some spikes in covid around the city and state.
            Nevertheless, I am enthralled to see East Lansing once alive again,
            returning to it's former pre-Covid glory.

        <article><strong>2021 Summer Vacation</strong></article>

            This past summer was filled with oppurtunity and great times. For the 
            first time in forever, I visited Florida again to see Universal Studios
            as well as DisneyWorld, and various other theme parks with my family. 
            Shortly after, I made my long awaited trip back to California. I had
            lived there 3 years ago, and was desperate for a return to see my old 
            friends. The first two days back in my home, I spent with some high 
            school friends and explored Santa Cruz and the beach. After that, I
            went into San Francisco, with my father and two brothers: and we walked
            the Golden Gate Bridge, and traveled around all the different communities
            within the city. After the long day spent in SF, we went inland, towards
            the Bay Area, to visit our old city and schools. After waking up at our
            hotel, we drove around by some of our old schools, and visited our old 
            house, even though I still call it my home. There was something special
            about visiting our old city, and seeing how most of it had remained
            unchained, as it was expecting our return. That my was favorite part
            of the trip, to come back to a place, and see it exactly as how I left it.
