            My name is Joseph Griffin. I am a junior at Michigan State University
            studying Media and Information, with a focus in media management. I 
            live in East Lansing, less than a mile away from the beautiful campus
            that I call home, MSU. I enjoy learning about computers, building pcs,
            playing video games, reading, and partying with friends. Throughout my
            time at college, I've learned how valuable time is, and to spend it 
            doing things you love. I believe that to fully enjoy and experience 
            college, you need to make friends and try new things, despite if you
            are unsure about something, or if it scares you. Many of the fun new
            things I've done at college, came from experiences that I wasn't sure
            about at first, but in the end, I was glad I did it.

            One of my favorite things to do and pasttimes is watching movies and 
            tv shows. I mainly enjoy thrillers, neo-westerns, dramas, and action 
            films and shows. Some of my favorite movies include: Taxi Driver, Enemy,
            Apocalypse Now, The Dark Knight, Goodfellas, and Pulp Fiction. Some of my
            favorite tv-shows include: The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, True Detective, and
            Game of Thrones.
