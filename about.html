                My name is Joey Griffin, a junior at Michigan State University.
                I am currently studying Media and Information, looking to major
                in Media and Information Science and Management. I live in East 
                Lansing, Michigan, and enjoy the city life and and working. 
                I grew up in the Bay Area in California, and moved to Michigan
                during the summer of 2018. After finishing school in my city of 
                Midland, I began college at MSU in East Lansing. I mainly enjoy 
                coding, working on computers, reading, playing games, hiking,
                and partying with friends. My favorite part of college is the 
                fact that I can meet so many new people and connect with tons of
                others, and learn how I can establish networks with friends. Another
                one of my favorite hobbies is watching tv shows and movies. Over the 
                past few years, I have seen many different films and shows. 
                Below is a list of my favorite tv shows and movies:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Sopranos (1999-2007)</li>
                    <li>True Detective (2013-2019)</li>
                    <li>Breaking Bad (2008-2013)</li>
                    <li>Fight Club (1999)</li>
                    <li>Apocalypse Now (1979)</li>
